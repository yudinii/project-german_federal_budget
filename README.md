## Goal
The main purpose of this project is basically to see how much German Federal allocates their budget to supporting migrants and refugees. For this, I analyze the German Federal budget public data from official [bundeshaushalt website](https://www.bundeshaushalt.de/DE/Download-Portal/download-portal.html). I downloaded the data from 2020 to 2024 to see the serial trend of usage of the budget and compare between the years, also uncover important trends and insights into how funding for migrants and refugees has changed over time. Finally, I made it as interactive visulaization using Tableau.

Through this project, I wanted to answer these questions.
- How much of the budget does the German federal allocate each year to supporting refugees and migrants?
- What proportion of the total budget does this allocated amount represent?
- Is there a significant increase or decrease in the allocated budget? If so, to what extent?
- Are there any observable trends in the allocated budget over time?
