## Goal
The main purpose of this project is basically to see how much German Federal allocates their budget in supporting migrants or refugees. For this, I analyze the German Federal budget public data from official bundeshaushalt [website](https://www.bundeshaushalt.de/DE/Download-Portal/download-portal.html). I used the data from 2020 to 2024 to see also the serial trend of usage of the budget and compare between the years. Finnaly, i made it as interactive visulaization using Tableau.
